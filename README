Please note that Dijkstras Algorithm is used to calculate shortest path based on priority queue and adjacency list. The code for this is copied from : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dijkstras-shortest-path-algorithm-using-priority_queue-stl/

Some parts of the algo are modified to meet the needs of our problem (like find next path if min path does not satisfy k hops)
